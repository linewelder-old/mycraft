# Mycraft

*Not a very original name, not a very original game.* A small Minecraft clone.
The main purpose of the project is coding practice. The second main purpose is
to have my own Minecraft.

## Current State

The game is still in active development.

### What Works

- Placing and destroying blocks
- Transparent water
- Day/night cycle with sunsets and sunrises

### What Does not Work

- No multithreading
- The light engine does not work properly since the addition of cubic chunks
- Chunk loading affects the framerate badly

## Credits
